# Additional tools and features

When using Peppol-compliant transactions, you will be able to use some
additional tools that are available in the tools page. These tools will
again help you improve your workflow during the day.

The additional tools that are available once you have introduced
Peppol-compliant documents to your system are:

-   Document comparison

-   SEPA XML file creation

#### Document comparison 

This tool will allow you to compare to documents, item-by-item, and will
visualize you the differences between both items.

For more information, please go to the following
[section](../System%20Overview/Tools.md#document-comparison-tool) where you can find a more in-depth
guide on how to use this tool.

#### File exportation 

Once you have various validations released in your system that are
Peppol-compliant, you will be able to generate various exportations
related to these validations.

For more information on how to export documents, please see the
following [section](../System%20Overview/Validations.md#exporting-documents).
