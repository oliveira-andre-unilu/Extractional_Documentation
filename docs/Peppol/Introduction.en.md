# Introduction

This Chapter will consist on explaining all Peppol features that our
system offers as well helping you setting all these features in your
system. We will also help you guide on how to use these features
afterwards.

## What is Peppol about what would be the interest to integrate in your system

Maybe you were familiar with Peppol, Peppol is a standardized way to
send invoices from one company to another. As most companies regularly
use this system, our company thought about using these standards to add
some helpful features to our system.

What is special about Peppol compliant documents is that all Peppol
compliant invoices are forced to use a certain pattern and this pattern
will allow us to extract even more information from your documents, thus
automating some of the processes of your company.

One of the features that will be available to all Peppol compliant
documents is that the system will not only look at a certain document
and extract the general information about it (Name, Date, Sum(brut),
etc.) but will also itemize all items that can be found in the document
and save all the informations in each item specified in your document to
use it for further features in the system.
