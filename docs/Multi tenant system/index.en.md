# Configuring the System for Multi-Organization Support

In this part of the manual, we will explain how to configure your system to have several sub-organisations within the same system.

This functionality will allow your system to have suborganizations working on the same system/server. This will allow your multi-organizational company to all work within the same license and server, improving both costs and energy using our system.

!!! warning "**Important**"
    It is important to understand that all sub-organizations work independently from each other and that no information or user are shared across any of the platforms.
