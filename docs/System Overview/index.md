## General principles

### General navigation principles for all tables

Example of a table:

![image](../img/Screenshots/Dashboard/Released_documents_table.png){width="1000"}

To enhance usability for all tables, several navigation features are
available:

-   To switch between **Incoming** and **Outgoing** documents, use the
    tabs at the top of the table.

-   To **sort table elements** by a specific column, click on the column
    header. An icon will indicate the current sorting order (ascending
    or descending). Clicking repeatedly toggles between the sorting
    options or removes the sorting.

-   To search for a specific row, use the search bar in the top-right
    corner of the table. Searches are conducted based on the information
    visible in the table.

-   To adjust the number of rows displayed per page, click on the
    current items-per-page indicator at the top of the table and select
    your preferred amount.

-   To navigate between pages, use the pagination controls at the bottom
    of the table.
